    <h2>Hello.</h2>
    <p class="biography">My name is Randy Fondeur I was born in the Dominican Republic and came to the United States when I was a year old.
      I grew up most of my life in New York City up until I was 17 and joined the military.
      Growing up I never even had an idea what coding was it was never exposed to me until 2 years ago.
      After I finished my military contract my God Brother and mentor Sparky Evangelista introduced me to coding.
      I am not a professional but I hope to one day become a Web Developer so I can continue learning, growing and also help as many people as I can along the way. </p>

      <h3>Leadership</h3>
      <p>Leadership is a skill that I hold dear to my heart and cherish because it is something that can be done wrong.
        If done wrong it can lead to an unproductive and a closed-minded work place.
        If you lead with respect and you are willing to listen to your peers than you are one step closer to becoming a better leader.
        You are never to old to learn something. </p>

      <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
      <p>I have been through many different experiences in the military while I was serving and one crucial skill I learned was problem solving.
        Being able to identify a problem and solve them as quickly and effieciently as possible is something that is a necesity in work and everyday life.</p>
